## Vision
The **OnlineQuiz** smart contract provides a decentralized platform for hosting quizzes on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to participate in a quiz by submitting answers, automatically scores their responses, and ensures that each user can only participate once. The contract is designed to be simple, scalable, and secure, enabling easy expansion for additional questions and functionalities.

## Flowchart

1. **Initialization**
   - Contract deployed.
   - Quiz questions and options are pre-loaded into the contract.

2. **User Participation**
   - User submits answers.
   - Contract checks if the user has already participated.
   - Answers are validated and scored.
   - User's score is recorded.

3. **Score Retrieval**
   - User requests their score.
   - Contract checks if the user has participated.
   - User's score is returned.

4. **Question Retrieval**
   - User requests a specific question.
   - Contract returns the question text and options.
